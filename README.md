# Jupiter Swap Project

This project uses the Jupiter Swap SDK to swap tokens to SOL on the Solana blockchain.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Set your wallet's private key as an environment variable or replace the placeholder in the script.

3. Implement the `getNonZeroBalanceTokens` function in `src/index.js` to return the list of token addresses with non-zero balances.

4. Run the script:
   ```
   node src/index.js
   ```

## Note

Make sure to use your own Solana RPC endpoint for better performance and reliability.
